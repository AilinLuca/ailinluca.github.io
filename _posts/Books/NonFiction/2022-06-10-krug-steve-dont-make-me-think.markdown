1. Don't make me think
- Avoid jargon or idiosyncratic language. (e.g. "Jobs" not "Job-o-Rama")
- Make it clear what is clickable. Changing the pointer is not enough. It must be self-evident.

2. How we really use the web:
- People don't read, they scan.
- People don't consider all options and pick the best, they pick the first obvious, reasonable one.
- People don't figure out how things work, they stick with what works well enough.

3. Billboard design 101:
- Create a clear visual hierarchy on each page
- Take advantage of conventions
- Break pages up into clearly defined areas
- Make it obvious what's clickable
- Minimize noise

4. Animal, Mineral, or Vegetable? Why users like mindless choices
- Number of clicks is not the only metric, it's difficulty choosing which click
- The exception is it is good to reduce number of clicks to frequently visited locations

5. Omit Needless Words: The Art of Not Writing for the Web
- Omit happy talk
- Omit instructions, people do not read them

6. Street Signs and Breadcrumbs
- Adhere to convention
- Navigation to stay fixed on each page (except home and forms sometimes)
- Navigation should contain: 
-- Site ID: name, logo, 
-- a way home, 
-- sections: primary navigation and sometimes secondary
-- search: search options are often better as filters for results
-- and utilities
- Page should display at least top two levels of hierarchy and show the user where they are in the hierarchy
- Designer should map out all lower levels of hierarchy as well 
- Avoid stacked underlined links in many cases because they are hard to read.

- Page names:
-- Every page should have a name
-- Name shuld be ni the right place and prominent (right aligned is often more effective than centered)
-- Name should match what was clicked

- Breadcrumbs:
-- Useful but not adequate alone (cannot replace hierarchy or page name)
-- Put them at the top
-- Use > to divide levels
-- Boldface the last item

(Krug was a big fan of tabs for their physicality and pop, if they are done correctly--drawn accurately with pop distingushing which tab is currently selected and one tab must be selected at all times. Tabs have since faen out of favor.)

- Trunk test:
Step 1: Choose a page anywhere in the site at random. 
Step 2: Hold at arms' length and squint so it can't be read clearly.
Step 3: As quickly as possible, try to find each of the following:
-- Site ID
-- Page name
-- Sections and subsections
-- Local navigation
-- You are here indicators
-- Search

7. The first step in recovery is admitting that the Home page is beyond your control: Designing the Home Page

Home page goals (physical):
- Site identity and mission: what it's for and why you should use it
- Site hierarchy: Content and features and how it's organized, usually communicated via navbar
- Search
- Teases: Content and/or feature promos spotlighting the best content and things to do on the site (e.g. personalization and newsletters)
- Timely content
- deals
- Short-cuts
- Registration

Home page goals (abstract):
- Show what I'm looking for
- Show what I'm not looking for
- Show me where to start
- Establish credibility and trust

Home page should answer:
- What is this? 
- What can I do here?
- What do they have here?
- Why should I be here--and not somewhere else?

How to ge the message across:
- Welcome Blurb: A short description of the site that is visible without scrolling. Use as much space as necessary. This is NOT the same as a mission statement; it is site-specific.
- Tagline: A phrase that characterizes the whole enterprise. Should be located near Site ID, be clear and informative, convey differentiation and a clear benefit, and are personable, lively and clever without hindering the other tagline goals (e.g. "World's largest archive of cheat codes and game tips").

Navigation on the home page can be different:
- This helps the user figure out where they want to go
- A blurb can be added for each section, there can be a different orientation, Site ID can be more prominent

Rollovers and pulldowns can be bad because they move and are therefore harder to use. 

Mistakes:
- Avoid banner ads on the homepage -- it distracts from Site ID
- Do not promote everything on the homepage -- reduce clutter
- Do not put user login walls on the main page -- users are reluctant to enter data until they know what they will get out of it is worth it

8. The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends: Why most web design team arguments about usability are a waste fof time, and how to avoid them
- Avoid unsolvable design conflicts with user testing.
- There is no "average user."
- We can't assume our own preferences are the same as the user's preferences.

9. Usability Testing on 10 cents a day: Keeping Testing Simple So You Do Enough Of It
- Focus groups are not usability tests. Focus groups are done at the early stages to gauge general opinion on things. Usability tests test if users can understand how the product works. 
- Test early and often. 

Cheap and fast testing:
- Three or four users
- Do not have to match the target audience
- Conduct in an office or conference room
- Can be conducted by any rasonbly patient human being
- Can be done almost any time, with little advanced scheduling
- Decide what you're going to show
- Run small tests continually throughout the development process
- Costs about $300 ($50 - $100 stipend for each user)
- Each observer writes one page of notes the day of the test. The devlopment team can debrief the same day. No need for lengthy reports.

Recruit loosely and grade on a curve
- Users tested do not have to match targets except:
- If the site is going to be used almost exclusively by one type of user and it's not hard to recruit them
- If the audicene is split by clearly defined gropus with very diverse interests and needs (e.g. students, professors, and parents), then representation may be useful
- If the site requires specific design knowledge

When recruiting:
- Avoid discussion the site or the organization behind the site beforehand. They should be able to figure it out.

Testing varies at each phase: 
- TODO insert image here

Types of testing
- Get it testing: Do users understand teh purpose of the site , the value proposition, how it's organized, etc
- Key task testing: Ask users to do something and see how they do. This is more useful when users have input on the task, so it is realistic.
- Cublic testing: Hand forms you've designed over to your neighbor and have them review it to see if it makes sense

10. Usability Testing: The Movie: How to do your own testing

To do: 
- Try the test yourself first.
- Protect the participants. Do not make them feel dumb.
- Be empathetic. 
- Try to observe their thought process. Ask for clarification if needed ("What are you looking at? What are you thinking?"). You are evaluating their expecations at each step and how close the site comes to matching their expectation. 
- Don't give them hints about what to do next. Instead ask "What do you think you should do? What would you do if you were at home?"
- Keep your instructions simple:
-- "Look around the page and tell me what you think everything is and what you would be likely to click on."
-- "Tell me what you would click on next and wha tyou expect you would see then."
-- "Try to think out loud as much as possible."
- Probe to understand exactly what hte user is reacting to.
- Don't be afraid to improvise, e.g. if the participant gets stuck. 
- Don't be disappointed
- Take notes immediately after each section about what struck you

What to do notice you're observing: 
- Do they get it? 
- Can they find their way around?
- Note moments when the user does or doesn't do seomthing that makes everyone slap their foreheads
- Note things that shock you
- Note things that inspire you 
- Note what elements users are passionate about
- Be quiet
- Remember you are seeing user's best behavior so if they are struggling, they are facing a really difficult issue that they normally wouldn't devote so much time to
- Pay more attention to actions and explanations than opinions

11. On Not Throwing The Baby Out With the Dishes: Interpreting Test Results
- As soon as possible after user testing, the development team should review: 
-- triage: review the problems people saw and decide which ones need to be fixed
-- problem solving: figuring out how to fix them

How to solve:
- Always consider tweaking first. What's the least we could do that might fix th eproblems we're seeing? If reasonable, mock it up and test as soon as possible.
- Focus on specifics. 
- Tweak, but verify. 
- If the problem is deep, bite the bullet. 
- It is almost never too late to challenge basic assumptions. 

Typical problems:
-
