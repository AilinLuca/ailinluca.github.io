### First sentence

A convenience store is a world of sound. (pg. 1)

### Favorite sentence

"No, I can't go with you. Think of me as an animal, a convenience store animal. I can't betray my instinct." (pg. 162)

I like how this is funny, but also the dramatic emotional peak of the story, when the woman realizes where she belongs. 

### Writing Techniques

1. Present-tense POV 

- Immediately immersive. It is a natural tense to describe events as they are happening and gives a sense of possibilty to every page.

- Allows clean transition into the main character's backstory simply by switching to past tense. e.g. "I was born into a normal suburban residential area. But everyone thought I was a rather strange child." (pg. 6)

2. First-person POV

- Quirky perspective makes the mundane new. 

- Strange behavior accepted as reasonable to the character creates tension. e.g. "She kept crying uncontrollably without responding to my request. Lost for something to do I took a custard pudding out of the refrigerator and ate it as I watcher her sitting there sobbing" (pg. 132). Also when the main character decides to live with her odious former coworker, which is a very strange decision for most normal people, given how he is described as creepy, sexist, and with horrible dental hygiene.

- Simple, matter-of-fact descriptions are very accessible.

3. Focused problem and solution can be read as an allegory for greater societal issues without becoming jumbled and theoretical. 

- The plot stays in the present tense in the unraveling of a specific circumstance that occurs in the course of a few weeks. This is focused and engaging.

### Last sentence

I could distinctly feel all my cells stirring within my skin as they responded in unison to the music reverberating on the other side of the glass. (pg. 163)

### Thoughts

- Potentially interesting commentary on the new manifestation of humanity's instinctual drive to fit in. Companies take us away from our traditional social structures. Employee guides take the place of what were once homogenous societal norms.
