### Writing Techniques

1. First-person past-tense POV 

- Combined with the subject matter, feels like listening to your grandfather. This creates an idyllic mood, high in reflection, but lacking in urgency.

2. Short, punchy final sentences.

- Interesting pattern. Creates a heavy, predictable cadence.
