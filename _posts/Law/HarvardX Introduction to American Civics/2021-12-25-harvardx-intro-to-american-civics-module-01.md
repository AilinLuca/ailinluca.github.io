## SUMMARY

### Module 1: Kinds of Law. This module introduces you to some key distinctions you will encounter in the law, in particular distinctions between the main sources of law in the U.S. system: constitutions, statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions. 

### Module 2: What is Law? This module highlights the difficulties of determining what identifies a rule as a legal rule, as opposed to a rule of a game or of morality, and delves briefly into the relationship of law to morality.

### Module 3: Federal vs. State Law and Order of Authorities. This module will help you understand the “order of authorities” (sometimes also called “hierarchy of authorities”) in the U.S. legal system – what sources of law prevail over other sources.

### Module 4: How a Bill Becomes Law. This module will help you understand the process by which a bill becomes law in the federal system. We will discuss the ten steps involved, including the introduction of the bill, committee action, referral to the other chamber, and the possibility of a presidential veto. You will learn some of the ways in which congressional procedures, checks and balances, and political realities (by design) make the passage of laws difficult.

## Module 1: Kinds of Law

- Domestic law: The law that is made by U.S. sovereigns and governs activities on U.S. soil. In some cases, it may also govern U.S. citizens or others within the jurisdictional power of the U.S. even though they may not be physically present in the U.S.  
- There are four kinds of U.S. domestic law.

### 1. Constitution Law

- While Britain had constitutional tradition, it did not have constitutional law. 
- U.S. Federal Constitution was ratified in 1789. Bill of Rights (first 10 amendments) added 1791.
- The Federal Constitution creates the government's three branches and delineates Federal and State jurisdiction.
- Note that individual states have their own constitutions, so it is useful to specify "Federal" Constitution. State constitutions cannot violate Federal Constitution. 

### 2. Statutory Law

- Laws enacted by the legislative branch.
- Federal law becomes law via bicameralism and presentment.
- Bicameralism: Federal statutes are passed by House and Senate.
- Presentment: Federal statues are then presented to the president who signs them or vetoes them. The president's veto is overruled by 2/3 vote of each house.
- Example key federal laws: Affordable Care Act, Emergency Medical Care and Treatment Act (EMTALA) (requires all persons who arrive at emergency department to be stabilized and treated).
- States also have statutes but not all states have two legislative houses.

### 3. Regulations

- Congress delegates power to some Federal Administrative Agencies to create regulations to answer questions not in statutes.
- E.g. Congress passed Title IX of the Education Amedments in 1972. Federal civil rights statute that eradicates sex discrimination in institutions that receive federal funds. 
-  Does Title IX permit sports teams segregated by gender? The Department of Education promulgated a regulation that addressed this: 34 C.F.R. 106.41 allows separate teams for members of each sex for teams based on competitive skill or contact sports.
- C.F.R. is short for Collection of Federal Regulations.
- Informal regulations are called guidances. E.g. FDA guidance on how much rat hair is allowed in chocolate.

### 4. Judicial Decisions

- Resolve disputes between parties.
- May be resolved with Constitutional Law or other existing law. If that is not possible, rule by precedent (aka Common Law decision-making).
- Administrative agencies are also empowered to adjudicate on some issues, but this is considered _administrative adjudication_ rather than judicial decisions.

## Module 2: What is Law?

- In addition to previous module, law also includes: state constitutions, state statutes, state regulations, and international law, etc.
- However, not all law is written down. Judges must decide on cases for which no law is explicitly written.
- Not all rules, even good rules, are legal rules.
- The law is constantly evolving and we should push to change the law if we think it is right.
- Liability: Legal responsibility. Someone is liable for a harm suffered by a party when he or she is legally and financially responsible for that harm.

## Module 3: Federal vs. State Law

- Each of the four types of U.S. domestic law have state counterparts
- Federalism: A form of government, such as in the U.S., in which power is divided between a central (federal) government and regional (state) governments.
- Federalism is not unique to the U.S. Canada also has federal and provincial statutes.
- The U.S. uniquely has significant overlap in the jurisdiction between federal and state courts. 

### Order of authorities:
1. U.S. Constitution
2. Federal Statute. 
3. Federal Regulations
4. Judicial Decisions. If Congress doesn't like a judicial decision, Congress can pass a statute to overrule it. Regulations can also overrule Judicial Decisions.

> e.g. Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber, Co., Inc. (2007). Lilly Ledbetter realized she was earning 40% less than male counterparts. Did she have to bring claim of discrimination within 180 days of the pay decision she was complaining about or when she felt the effects of the decision? Supreme Court decided it must be filed when she felt the effects. Congress passed Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 which reset the window to file with each paycheck received as opposed to when the discriminatory decision was made.

> CAVEAT: Marbery v. Madison (1803). The U.S. Supreme Court has the final say on what the Constitution means. Judiciary can declare a statute or regulation unconstitutional and can have it struck down or reinterpreted.

5. State Constitution
6. State Statutes
7. State Regulations
8. State Judicial Decisions

Note that federal hierarchy is echoed in state law. 
Every state has its own state law, and it may conflict with laws in other state so long as it does not conflict with federal law.

> e.g. Self-defense. A minority of states enforce duty to retreat where you cannot claim self-defense if you could have safely retreated. Most states have a no-retreat rule; you can meet force with force. 

def. Duty to Retreat: Also known as a “retreat rule.” A requirement of the criminal law of some states that you may not claim self-defense if you could have safely retreated, but did not, before using deadly force against an attacker.

### How to change the Constitution

1. Wait for the Supreme Court justices to change, then argue that the original ruling was wrong. 

> e.g. Lawrence v. Texas (2003). Overruled Bowers v. Hardwick (1986) which had criminalized gay sex. Court determined Bowers was wrong today and back in  1986. 

2. Amendment to the Constitution may be proposed by: 
- Congress with a 2/3 majority vote in both the House and the Senate or
- A Constitutional convention called by 2/3 of State legislatures
