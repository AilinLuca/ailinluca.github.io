## SUMMARY

### Module 2 Lesson 3: Back to basics

- Understand how the following fundamental programming concepts are manifested in Java: whitespace, commenting, errors, variables, types, expressions, and casting.

---

## Whitespace

- def. blanks, tabs, and newline characters
- Any whitespace added beyond separating words and symbols is ignored by the compiler

## Errors

- Three types
  - compiler
  - runtime
  - logical
- Syntax vs. semantics
  - Syntax: rules of the language
  - Semantics: what a statement does or its meaning
  - Code that is syntactically correct is not always semantically correct. Code may compile, but may not do what you want it to do.

#### Compile and runtime errors

- Compiler errors represent syntax violations found in your code
